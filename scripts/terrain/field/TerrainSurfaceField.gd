# scripts/terrain/field/TerrainSurfaceField.gd
# Pure, continuous walkable-surface height reconstructed from a HeightfieldRegion.
# Flat on cell interiors; ramps toward lower neighbours (added in later tasks).
# Single-valued everywhere ⇒ when sampled on a shared grid, adjacent cells/chunks
# share identical boundary vertices ⇒ the mesh is gap-free by construction.
